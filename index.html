            The universe is a collection of millions of galaxies and extends
            beyond human imagination. After the big bang, the universe was found
            to be composed of radiation and subatomic particles. Information
            following the big bang is arguable on how galaxies formed, that is
            whether small particles merged to form clusters and eventually
            galaxies or whether the universe systematized as immense clumps of
            matter that later fragmented into galaxies (Nasa World book, 2013).

            Group of galaxies. The Andromeda galaxy is the closest full-size
            galaxy to the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy is about four times
            bigger than the moon in the sky. Andromeda contains around one
            trillion stars. The Andromeda Galaxy is also the only galaxy
            noticeable to the naked eye in the Northern Hemisphere. The
            Andromeda Galaxy is the Milky Way's largest galactic acquaintance
            and is on course for a collision in the future. It is believed that

            A dwarf galaxy is, “a small galaxy composed of up to several billion
            stars—a smaller amount compared to our own Milky Way’s Galaxy’s
            200-400 billion stars” (Wikipedia). On February 23, 2014, it was
            reported that two galaxies that had once orbited around the
            Andromeda Galaxy were merging together. The collision created a
            stream of stars in one of Andromeda’s dwarf galaxies, Andromeda II.

            system of millions in a galaxy of many more in the universe. A
            galaxy, also called a nebula, consists of billions of stars,
            interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter which are all bound to form
            a massive cloud in which we live. Although it cannot be very well
            explained, dark matter makes up at least 90% of a galaxy’s mass.
            Galaxies also contain billions upon billions of stars and their
            diameter can range from 1,500 to 300,000 light-years.
